Resumator Website:
A website that enables users to create a resume by filling out the information, the data is stored in the server using MySQL and can be retrieved to make the resume.

How to run the program:

1) For the client side, open the terminal, type 'cd client', then 'npm install'
2) Once the node modules folder is created, type 'npm start in the terminal
3) For the server side, open another terminal and type 'npx json-server --watch backend/database.json --port 3001'

All done! You should be able to see and use IMD Resumator :)
